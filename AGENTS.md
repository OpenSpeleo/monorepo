# Monorepo Workflow

## Model

This repository is a git-subtree monorepo.

- Each top-level subtree directory maps to an upstream repository.
- Subtree directory names often match git remote names, but verify the mapping before manual subtree commands.
- Run monorepo commands from the repository root.

## Rules

- Never use regular `git push` to publish the monorepo itself as a deployment target.
- Work in a single monorepo branch by default. A subtree may use a different push branch when local git config explicitly overrides it.
- Keep changes scoped to the subtree or subtrees you intend to update.
- Edit files inside subtree directories, not in unrelated top-level folders.
- Prefer separate commits per subtree unless the change is tightly coupled across repos.
- Push only subtrees that actually changed.
- Keep subtree directory, remote name, and configured push branch consistent.
- Do not mix files from different subtrees in a subtree PR.

## CLI

If `unirepo` is not installed, install it first:

```bash
npm install -g unirepo-cli
```

Preferred when the `unirepo` CLI is available:

```bash
unirepo version
unirepo status
unirepo branch <branch>
unirepo pull
unirepo push --dry-run
unirepo push
unirepo pr --title "feat: ..." --body "..."
unirepo add <repo-url> --branch <branch>
```

- `status` shows tracked subtrees, upstream branches, the current workspace branch, each subtree's effective push branch, and changed files.
- `branch <name>` creates the default local branch to reuse when pushing subtrees upstream.
- `pull` updates one or more tracked subtrees from upstream before or during your work. Use `--prefix` when you want a branch-specific pull for just one subtree.
- `push --dry-run` is the safe first step before a real push.
- `push` without subtree names auto-detects changed subtrees. `push <subtree>` pushes one subtree.
- `pr` opens one PR per changed or explicitly selected subtree repo after those branches have been pushed, using each subtree's effective push branch as the default PR head.
- `add` imports another repository as a subtree. Use `--branch` to import from a non-default upstream branch.

## Workflow

1. Create or reuse one default branch name for the work.
CLI:
```bash
unirepo branch <branch>
```
Git:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch>
```

2. Pull upstream updates when needed.
CLI:
```bash
unirepo pull
unirepo pull --prefix <subtree> --branch <branch>
```
Git:
```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=<subtree> <remote-or-url> <branch> --squash
```

3. Make changes inside one or more subtree directories.

4. Commit in the monorepo. Use one commit per subtree when the changes are independent. When a change is tightly coupled across subtrees (e.g. a shared type change that requires simultaneous updates in both the library and the consumer), commit all affected subtrees together in a single commit so the intent is clear.
```bash
# Single subtree
git add <subtree>/
git commit -m "feat(<subtree>): ..."

# Coupled change across subtrees
git add <subtree-a>/ <subtree-b>/
git commit -m "feat: ..."
```

5. Inspect what changed before pushing.
CLI:
```bash
unirepo status
```
Git:
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

6. Push only changed subtrees.
CLI:
```bash
unirepo push --dry-run
unirepo push
unirepo push <subtree>
```
Git:
```bash
git subtree push --prefix=<subtree> <remote-or-url> <branch>
```

7. Open one PR per upstream subtree repo after push.
CLI:
```bash
unirepo pr --title "feat: ..." --body "..."
unirepo pr <subtree> --title "feat: ..."
```

## Raw Git Subtree

Use these when operating without the CLI:

```bash
# Add a subtree
git subtree add --prefix=libfoo https://github.com/example/libfoo.git main --squash

# Pull updates from upstream
git subtree pull --prefix=libfoo https://github.com/example/libfoo.git main --squash

# Push local changes upstream
git subtree push --prefix=libfoo https://github.com/example/libfoo.git <branch>
```

- If subtree directory and remote name match, the remote name often works in place of the full URL.
- By default, subtrees reuse the monorepo branch name. To override one subtree, set `git config unirepo.subtree.<subtree>.pushBranch <branch>`.

## PRs

- Open one PR per upstream subtree repo.
- By default, PR heads follow each subtree's effective push branch.
- Target the default branch of the upstream repo unless that repo's workflow says otherwise.
- Run `unirepo pr` only after the head branch exists upstream for that subtree repo.
- Ensure each PR contains only changes from its own subtree.
